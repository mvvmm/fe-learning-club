      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>
        A sunflower, a tall, round flower with large yellow petals. Depicted as
        a single, vertical sunflower with a large, dark-brown center on a green
        stem. Commonly used for Mother's Day and other special occasions. May be
        more generally used to convey such sentiments happiness and love. Also
        used as a yellow accent color and in association with summer and
        farming.

          I am a big of flower, and I think the sunflower is one of the
          prettiest. I like to use the sunflower as a sign of
          success/availability, for example:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>As a sign of availability in slack</p>
            <img
              src="../img/sunflower/slack.png"
              alt="availability in slack shown with sunflower"
              width="200"
            />
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>A sign of a successful command in my terminal</p>
            <img
              src="../img/sunflower/terminal.png"
              alt="a successfully run terminal command shown with a sunflower"
              width="700"
            />
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
