        A thumbs-up gesture indicating approval. In certain contexts, the use of
        the Thumbs Up emoji can be construed as being passive aggressive or
        sarcastic. Despite this possible use, it remains a popular means of
        quickly and earnestly expressing approval.

        I like to use this emoji to portray my understanding/agreement of a
        subject. I especially like to use the emoji in conjunction with the
        <a href="../pages/smiling-face-with-sunglasses.html"
          >Smiling Face with Sunglasses</a
        >
        emoji. It's nice 😎👍
